// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where user expecations for a new software being built or modified are defined."
const design = "In the Design phase, developers and architects start the high-level design of the software to be able to deliver each requirement."
const implementation = "Developters code according to the requirements and design discussed in previous phases. Necessary data, interfaces, and GUI are created to interacte with the back-end."
const testingAndIntegration = "During Testing, experienced testers start to test the system against the requirements and aim to find defects. This cycle is repeated until all requirements have been tested and fulfilled."
const maintain = "After deployment, the maintenance team will look for any post-productions issues and push hot-fixes if necessary."
